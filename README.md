# Erlang Graphs Toolbox

There is [digraph module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/digraph.html) in Erlang [standard library](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/index.html) but it doesn't fit all purposes. It uses three  [ETS](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html) tables which has per VM limit (1400 by default). In case you would like to have 10000 of them you must increase this limit to 30000 ETS tables. There are also special use cases, where you would like to tune your inner graph representation. There is also the new type [maps](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/maps.html) since R17 which allows making interesting new graphs implementations. But most of the algorithms used can be shared between implementations. There also can be shared tests and tools for working with them. It all brings us to the attempt to make some toolbox for working with it. So here we are.
